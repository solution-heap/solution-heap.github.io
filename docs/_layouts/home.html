  <p><strong>A bit about us</strong></p>
  <p>Exams are often more difficult than homework and it doesn't make things easier when you still struggle with a solution memo because you don't understand how some questions were solved.
  </p>
  <p>Solutionheap allows the student to curate math questions from past exam papers so they can focus on the topics they most struggle with. Each question has a hint on how to solve it and every solution explains the steps in a simple and approachable way.
